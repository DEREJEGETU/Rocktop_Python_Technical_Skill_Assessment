5. Show duplicate values

6. Drop duplicate values

7. Show duplicate values (again)

8. Create a histogram using sepal length and their count

9. Create a histogram using sepal width and their count

10. Create two scatter plots - one using sepal length and sepal width AND the other using patal length and petal width. Display both next to each other

11. Create a scatter plot of sepal length and sepal width of certain species. Make it interactive so user can enter the name of the species and display its scatter plot

12. Save the result data into a new csv file and share it with us for review

##  POWER BI SKILLS ASSESSMENT - INSTRUCTIONS

As a mortgage related data company, we would like analyze home sales data using Power BI visualization.
Using the dataset provided, create power BI reports / graphs that will help us understand following
requirements

1. Total number of homes sold along with total revenue and the average sale price
2. Find cities to invest in by viewing average sale price by city
3. Locations where the houses were sold so we can concentrate on investing in prime locations
4. The minimum and maximum price of the houses sold
5. The type of houses sold and their average price
6. We would like to see which date the house was sold and its average price and average square feet (both
counts in the same graph)
8. provide a table with data listing City, Street, Beds, Baths, Square ft, price, %GT price and Week of the
month the property was sold
8.1 Group by City, the table lists one city for all addresses in that city. (i.e., the city should not be
repeated for each address)
9. We would like to filter the report by sale date, square ft, city and property type
